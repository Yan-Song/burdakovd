Guild Bank Mover v1.0
(probably the only version)

There are no options to select just tasks to do.

Commands:

/bank2bags - IF a "personal bank" window is open moves all
non-soulbound, non-quest items from any bank bag or bank slot
into any available slot in your bags

/bags2guildbank - IF a "Guild Bank" window is open moves all
non-soulbound, non-quest items from any inventory bag into any
available slot in your Guild Bank that you have deposit
permissions on, starts with the first slot on the first tab
and scans up when searching for an empty slot.

If anyone wants to extend this addon feel free.  I simply
made it because someone mentioned the idea in irc.
